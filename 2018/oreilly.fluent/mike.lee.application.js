:   [`2017.12.08.23:59:59-08

      ...but I missed the deadline by 1 minute so I sent my application to Ally
      McDonald via direct message @ fluent2018info.slack.com
      @ 2017.12.09.00:25-08. Longshot but we'll see. I should've submitted
      earlier but only got notified a week ago and spent my time working on my
      project instead of this proposal.

      THEY EXTENDED THE DEADLINE UNTIL MONDAY, 2017.12.11 !!!

      So @ 2017.12.08.16:54:04-08: I successfully submitted my application...
      and gave thanks!

, NOTES
:   `Choosing the best Audience Level was challenging. The "what" of my presentation's meant to appeal to & be understood by a wide audience including non-developers but the "how" will definitely be technical and likely appeal to intermediate and advanced developers. Hopefully the "Intermediate" level I chose will attract the right mix.

I also want to say that I really appreciate having a slack group to discuss Fluent-relevant things leading up to the event.`

, SCRIPT
:   [`Hi!

      Thanks for checking this out! I'm Mike Lee and I'm really excited to chat
      with you about ionify: implicit object notations invented for you, a
      flexible, unobtrusive & novel JavaScript API for expressing ideas via
      simple object interaction, observation & notification.

      Whew, lots of words, but what IS this thing?...And why care?

      Right. I created ionify, because I believe, digital expression can and
      should be as natural as speech and text, and ionify makes exploring that
      possibility fun...but how?

      ionify's built on ion: implicit object notation, an incredibly versatile
      software design pattern and programming language capability I discovered
      in 2007.

      ions are expressions that activate objects via implicit type conversion.
      Interacting with that implicit type conversion enables writing data & code
      as independently observable & notifiable objects. Think JSON, prefixed
      with a +, -, or ~. That's it.

      So why's that useful?

      Well. Together, ions and ionify enable exploring and experimenting with

        + domain-specific languages
        + literate, modular, and event-driven programming
        + and a whole lot more.

      I think that's great and definitely worth sharing. Hope you do too :-)

      If you wanna know more? Check out ionify on github. Also, Twitter. Come
      find me there @ iskitz, that's i...s...k...i...t...z.

      See ya!

I take full responsibility and understand that I missed the deadline but if it’s at all possible I’d like to still submit my application to speak at Fluent 2018. Here’re my details:

*Proposal title:*

ionify; expressing ideas via simple object interaction, observation & notification


*Description:*

Digital expression can, and should be, as natural as speech and text. ions & ionify make exploring what’s possible fun. ions are implicit object notations & ionify is ions invented for you, a JavaScript API that facilitates expressing ideas via simple object interaction, observation & notification. This talk intros and demos how their practical application simplifies various programming scenarios.


*Topic:* Future JS and Functional

*Secondary topics:* Hands-on & Technical

*Session Type:* 40-minute session

*Abstract:*

Digital expression can and should be, as natural as speech and text. *"ions":https://github.com/ionify/ionify/blob/public/info/ion.md* & *"ionify":https://github.com/ionify/ionify/blob/public/README.md* make exploring what’s possible fun.

*ions* are *implicit object notations* & *ionify* is *ions invented for you*, a flexible, unobtrusive & novel JavaScript API that facilitates expressing ideas via simple object interaction, observation & notification.

This talk introduces both and demonstrates how their practical application simplifies various programming scenarios via exploration of and experimentation with domain-specific languages and multiple programming paradigms.
