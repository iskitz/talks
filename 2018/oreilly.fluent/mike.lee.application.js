{ IS:
    "O'Reilly Fluent 2018 Conference Application"

, DUE
:   [`2017.12.08.23:59:59-08

      ...but I missed the deadline by 1 minute so I sent my application to Ally
      McDonald via direct message @ fluent2018info.slack.com
      @ 2017.12.09.00:25-08. Longshot but we'll see. I should've submitted
      earlier but only got notified a week ago and spent my time working on my
      project instead of this proposal.

      O'Reilly Media EXTENDED THE DEADLINE UNTIL MONDAY, 2017.12.11 !!!

              https://twitter.com/getify/status/939513336932261888

      So @ 2017.12.09.16:54:04-08: I successfully submitted my application,
      then recorded my application's video:
      
              https://youtu.be/H4P8phee9Q0
     
      and gave thanks!

              https://twitter.com/iskitz/status/939665245986942977
              
       Then redid my application's video to be more energetic:
       
              https://youtu.be/qErb8dYPyqg
       
       Then, read this the next day...after the deadline
       
              https://twitter.com/getify/status/940253208768909312
       
       and replied
       
              https://twitter.com/iskitz/status/940544134229532673
              
       so, we'll see. Should know in January if my talk's accepted
       or not. In the mean time, back to ionify!

, AUDIENCE
:   "JavaScript Developers & anyone interested in, but intimidated or frustrated by programming."


, AUDIENCE_TAKEAWAY
:   [`+ JavaScript’s flexibility; how type coercion facilitates language exploration.
      + A new style of programming with JS
      + Literate, modular & event-driven programming
    `]


, NOTES
:   `Choosing the best Audience Level was challenging. The "what" of my presentation's meant to appeal to & be understood by a wide audience including non-developers but the "how" will definitely be technical and likely appeal to intermediate and advanced developers. Hopefully the "Intermediate" level I chose will attract the right mix.

I also want to say that I really appreciate having a slack group to discuss Fluent-relevant things leading up to the event.`

, SCRIPT
:   [`Hi!

      Thanks for checking this out! I'm Mike Lee and I'm really excited to chat
      with you about ionify: implicit object notations invented for you, a
      flexible, unobtrusive & novel JavaScript API for expressing ideas via
      simple object interaction, observation & notification.

      Whew, lots of words, but what IS this thing?...And why care?

      Right. I created ionify, because I believe, digital expression can and
      should be as natural as speech and text, and ionify makes exploring that
      possibility fun...but how?

      ionify's built on ion: implicit object notation, an incredibly versatile
      software design pattern and programming language capability I discovered
      in 2007.

      ions are expressions that activate objects via implicit type conversion.
      Interacting with that implicit type conversion enables writing data & code
      as independently observable & notifiable objects. Think JSON, prefixed
      with a +, -, or ~ that enables independently observing & notifying those
      objects. That's it.

      So why's that useful?

      Together, ions and ionify enable exploring and experimenting with

        + domain-specific languages
        + literate, modular, and event-driven programming
        + and a whole lot more.

      I think that's great and it's been a whole lot of fun and I'd love to
      share that with you :-)

      If you'd like to know more? Find ionify on GitHub or find me on Twitter.
      I'm @ iskitz, that's i...s...k...i...t...z.

      See ya!
