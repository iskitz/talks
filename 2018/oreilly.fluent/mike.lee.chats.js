:   `Hi Ally,

I take full responsibility and understand that I missed the deadline but if it’s at all possible I’d like to still submit my application to speak at Fluent 2018. Here’re my details:

*Proposal title:*

ionify; expressing ideas via simple object interaction, observation & notification


*Description:*

Digital expression can, and should be, as natural as speech and text. ions & ionify make exploring what’s possible fun. ions are implicit object notations & ionify is ions invented for you, a JavaScript API that facilitates expressing ideas via simple object interaction, observation & notification. This talk intros and demos how their practical application simplifies various programming scenarios.


*Topic:* Future JS and Functional

*Secondary topics:* Hands-on & Technical

*Session Type:* 40-minute session

*Abstract:*

Digital expression can and should be, as natural as speech and text. *"ions":https://github.com/ionify/ionify/blob/public/info/ion.md* & *"ionify":https://github.com/ionify/ionify/blob/public/README.md* make exploring what’s possible fun.

*ions* are *implicit object notations* & *ionify* is *ions invented for you*, a flexible, unobtrusive & novel JavaScript API that facilitates expressing ideas via simple object interaction, observation & notification.

This talk introduces both and demonstrates how their practical application simplifies various programming scenarios via exploration of and experimentation with domain-specific languages and multiple programming paradigms.


*Who is the presentation for?*

JavaScript Developers & anyone interested in, but intimidated or frustrated by programming.


*Audience Level:* Intermediate


*List the main ideas and/or skills attendees will learn from your presentation.*

+ JavaScript’s flexibility; how type coercion facilitates language exploration.
+ A new style of programming with JS
+ Literate, modular & event-driven programming


*Prerequisite knowledge for this presentation*

Basic familiarity with or awareness of JavaScript, JSON & programming.


*Is this session more conceptual or how-to?*

Conceptual


*Diversity*

Yes, I’m an African American male.


*Travel & other expense reimbursements*

None; I’m local to San Jose.

: `Hi Kyle,

*tldr: ionify* [1] applies useful type coercion side-effects to enable language exploration, take a look?…& maybe give me a 2nd chance to submit it as a Fluent 2018 talk? :nerd_face: I missed the deadline…by a minute & am so very :disappointed:

*more words*
After missing the CFP deadline last night I read your *YDKJS: Types & Grammar: Chapter 4: Coercion* [2] hoping to find someone who sees the value & beauty in type coercion that I do. I did, so I’m checking your interest in *ionify: implicit object notations invented for you*, a project I created that applies useful [& interesting, IMO,] side-effects to JS’s numeric type coercion flow. I liked your positive & mature approach to that & many other maligned aspects of JS & wanted to share what I’m doing to advance our JS & web community’s awareness of that.

I tried to submit a Fluent 2018 proposal last night but missed the deadline [by 1 minute]. My fault but I’m hoping to still have a chance to share *ions* [3] & *ionify* with a community that’ll hopefully find it useful & delightful. I’d been chatting with Ally MacDonald [4] to select its best topic & sent her what would’ve been my submission early today. Sorry this post’s so long but erring on the side of being too verbose to share all I can.
