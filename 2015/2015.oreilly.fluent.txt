Description

jsonXD is a JavaScript library that allows defining *and* observing data using
JSON, JavaScript Array and Object literal syntax. Data can be observed by
defining listeners based on its structure which allows both data & listeners
to be loosely coupled and highly encapsulated. This talk presents and
discusses using jsonXD for natural language programming, message passing and
as a module system.

Session type: Session

Topics: Pure Code and JavaScript

Abstract

jsonXD is a JavaScript library that allows defining and observing data using
JSON, JavaScript Array and Object literal syntax:

    JSON : +{’id’:‘json data’}

    Array : +[{id:’data’}, {id:‘more data’}]

    Object: +{id:‘object literal data’}

It is compatible with all browsers and JavaScript runtimes supporting
ECMAScript 3 or later; i.e. Node.js, JavascriptCore, v8, Rhino.

Data observation is accomplished by listening for data matching a given
structure. A reference to the data is shared with listeners whenever data
matching the listener’s criteria becomes available. This allows both data
and their listeners to be loosely coupled and highly encapsulated. This
flexibility simplifies writing code that can be loaded asynchronously and
ran sequentially and/or concurrently.

jsonXD can be used standalone or with existing code as a module system, for
message passing, cross-domain data exchange and even natural language
programming:

    +[‘load moduleA and moduleB then do actionC.’];

This talk will explore these and other applications.
