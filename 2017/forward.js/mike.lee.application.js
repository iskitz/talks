        ` ionify is a project created to transform the symbols, constructs +
          concepts we call code, into the natural language words, phrases +
          sentences we use to share ideas.

          In this talk I'll introduce ionify + explain ions, the implicit
          object notation + implicit object notification concepts at its
          heart. I'll then show various ion + ionify applications that
          demonstrate ionify's new style of scripting.

          At the end of this talk I hope to have inspired you to create ions
          that share our best software design patterns, data structures +
          practices in ways that're appealing and accessible to everyone.

          I'll start with an explanation of ions, the implicit object notation &
          implicit object notification concepts at ionify's heart.

          Next, I'll introduce ionify & its new style of scripting that enables
          creating loosely coupled, highly coexistent & observable units of data
          & code.

          Finally, I'll demo & walk through an assortment of ion & ionify
          applications.

          By the end of this talk I hope to have inspired you to create ions
          that share our software's best design patterns, data structures &
          practices in ways that make coding appealing and accessible to
          everyone.

  talk:
    [`Imagine enabling everyone who's ever thought "if only I could code" to
      do just that. That's the idea at the heart of ionify, implict object
      notification implemented for you.

      ionify was created and exists to transform the symbols, constructs,
      and concepts we call code, into the words, phrases, and sentences we use
      to share ideas.

      This talk introduces ion: the implict object notification design
      pattern, ions: objects implementing that pattern, and ionify: implicit
      object notification implemented for you.

      We'll explore

      + the ion pattern,
      + its implict type conversion flow,
      + ajile's design concepts and considerations,
      + and a collection of natural language ions that simplify sharing ideas.

      Through this talk I hope to inspire you to create ions that share our
      best software design patterns, data structures, and practices in ways
      that make coding appealing and accessible to everyone wishing they
      could.
