Session Title:

	Extending JSON for Cross-Domain Data Interchange Today.


Session Description:

	JSON is emerging as the data interchange format of choice for the web, but it's full
	potential is hampered by browser's same-origin policy and a lack of JSON data definition
	standards.

	This session introduces a new way to define JSON data for simplified, automated, and
	cross-domain data interchange in all ECMAScript-262-compatible environments.

	Attend and discover how to:

	- Define cross-domain JSON.
	- Consume cross-domain JSON without server proxies, JSON/P or XHR.
	- Request cross-domain JSON from existing JSON/P services.
	- Add cross-domain JSON support to existing JSON services.
	- Extend JSON for richer and/or more structure data definition.
