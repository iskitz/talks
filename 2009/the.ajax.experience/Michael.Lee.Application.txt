1. Session title:

	Cross-domain, Client-side JSON Exchange


2. Session description:

	Introducing a new client-side technique for exchanging JSON across domains.


3. What development problem(s)/challenge(s) will your session address?

	Developers are currently limited to server-side proxies, same-domain XHR, and
	JSON/P techniques for accessing remote JSON data. I will introduce a new
	solution to those limitations.


4. What are you addressing that represents or indicates a new or emerging trend? And why do attendees need to be aware of this information TODAY?

	JSON is fast becoming the Web's data exchange format of choice. I will
    provide developers with an immediate, browser-compatible solution to
    their current cross-domain JSON exchange challenges.
