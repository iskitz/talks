  DESCRIPTION:
    [`ionify, implict object notification invented for you, is a project
      created to transform the symbols, constructs, and concepts we call code,
      into the words, phrases, and sentences we use to share ideas.

      It's composed of ion, the implict object notification design pattern,
      ions, objects implementing that pattern, and ajile, a judiciously ionic
      linguistic engine.

      This talk introduces and explains ion and ajile, and explores a
      collection of ions that express interesting ideas using natural
      language.

  ABSTRACT:
    [`ionify, implict object notification invented for you, is a project
      created to transform the symbols, constructs, and concepts we call code,
      into the words, phrases, and sentences we use to share ideas every day.

      It's composed of ion, the implict object notification design pattern,
      ions, objects implementing that pattern, and ajile, a judiciously ionic
      linguistic engine.

      This talk introduces and explores

      + the ion pattern,
      + its implict type conversion flow,
      + ajile's design concepts and considerations,
      + and a collection of natural language ions that simplify sharing ideas.

      Through this talk I hope to inspire you to create ions that share our
      best software design patterns, data structures, and practices in ways
      that make coding appealing and accessible to everyone wishing they
      could.

  SCRIPT:
    [`Imagine enabling everyone who's ever thought "if only I could code" to
      do just that. That's the idea at the heart of ionify, implict object
      notification invented for you.

      ionify was created and exists to transform the symbols, constructs,
      and concepts we call code, into the words, phrases, and sentences we use
      to share ideas.

      This talk introduces ion, the implict object notification design
      pattern, ions, objects implementing that pattern, and ajile, a
      judiciously ionic linguistic engine.

      We'll explore

      + the ion pattern,
      + its implict type conversion flow,
      + ajile's design concepts and considerations,
      + and a collection of natural language ions that simplify sharing ideas.

      Through this talk I hope to inspire you to create ions that share our
      best software design patterns, data structures, and practices in ways
      that make coding appealing and accessible to everyone wishing they
      could.

  FOCUS:
    [`PERFORMANCE FOR THE PEOPLE

      New approaches and technologies like service workers and HTTP2 are
      increasingly focusing on how they help people. With this, we're seeing
      an increased focus on design-of tools, of experiences, of human
      interactions. Has design, or design thinking, changed the way you
      approach your work, products, or teams?
