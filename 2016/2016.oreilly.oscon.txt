  ionify: Implict Object Notation Invented For You


DESCRIPTION

  ionify is a new software notation and design pattern that enables defining
  data and functionality modules using JavaScript's object and array literal
  notation and implicit type conversion. This talk:
  
  + Introduces ionify
  + Explains how it works
  + Demonstrates some of its exciting applications, like defining new languages


ABSTRACT

  ionify is a software notation and design pattern that enables defining data
  and functionality modules. It's built on three of JavaScript's earliest and
  enduring concepts:
  
  + Array  Literals
  + Object Literals
  + Implict Type Conversion
  
  ionify modules, ions, can be anonymous or named objects and are observable
  and self-contained; attributes which make them highly interoperable and
  well-suited for data exchange and custom language definition. ions's keys
  and values are observable via the evaluation flow JavaScript follows during
  implict conversion of objects to primitive types. This observation enables
  deriving meaning from those keys and values and thus defining languages.
